# Max's Simple Suspension Tester

## The plan

I plan to expand this into a lightweight and useful suspension profiler using C++. It should work for all types of suspension, especially four-bar or double wishbone.

## Github directory

The official github directory can be found [here](https://github.com/MaxIsmagilov/ATCSIndProj).
