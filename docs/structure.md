# How it will work

## Frontend

We do not worry about that right now

## Backend

The current idea is to have several components, including bars

### Things to do
- get some way to track the position of joints and rods (use a graph?)
- get some way to find positions when changing joints and rods
- find some quick-and-dirty output and input methond (some config file?)
