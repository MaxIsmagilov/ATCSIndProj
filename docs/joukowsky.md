# The Joukowsky Transform Airfoil

The [Joukowsky transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joukowsky_transform) is a way to generate airfoils. It is defined as ${z=\zeta+{\frac{1}{\zeta}}}$.

Where:
 - ${ \zeta }$ is a circle in the complex plane that intersects ${1}$ and encircles ${-1}$
 - ${z}$ is the the result of the transform, also in the complex plane.

The reason that this transform is useful is because the potential flow for a circle is analytic, meaning that the analytic solution of the circle can be mapped onto the Joukowsky airfoil.
